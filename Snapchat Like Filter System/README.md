# Snapchat Like Filter Sysytem 

By using this you can actually use your web camera to see filters used in snapchat applying with you.
I have used only four filters only will add more filters gradually.

This can be used for fun by simply running the .ipynb file in jupyter notebook after cloning the project and using it by your web camera.
